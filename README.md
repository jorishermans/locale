# locale

A library for Dart developers. It is awesome.

## Usage

The Locale class object represents a specific geographical, political, or cultural region. 
Following are the important points about Locale:

An operation that requires a Locale to perform its task is called locale-sensitive and uses the Locale to form information for the user.
Locale is a mechanism for identifying objects, not a container for the objects themselves.
